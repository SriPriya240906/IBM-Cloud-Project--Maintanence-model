# IBM-Cloud-Project--Maintanence-model
My IBM SkillsBuild Internship Journey (AI & Cloud)
Internship Start:
Joined the 4-week IBM SkillsBuild Internship by Edunet Foundation, AICTE & IBM, focused on AI & Cloud skills.

Skill Learning:
Learned basics of AI, machine learning, IBM Cloud, and how to use IBM watsonx.ai Studio for building models.

Project Title:
Worked on a capstone project: "Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery" to predict machine failures.

Problem Focus:
Goal was to predict types of machine failures (like tool wear, power failure) using sensor data.

Dataset Used:
Used a Kaggle dataset with features like air temp, torque, speed, tool wear, etc.

Platform:
Used IBM watsonx.ai on IBM Cloud Lite to upload data, train and test models using AutoML.

Model Training:
AutoML tested several models and selected the best one (Snap Random Forest) based on accuracy and F1-score.

Results:
Model gave up to 100% prediction confidence, trained in under 4 minutes, and showed reliable results.

Deployment:
Model was saved and can be deployed as an API for real-time use in maintenance dashboards.

My Learnings:
Gained hands-on experience in AI, Cloud, real-world problem solving, and completed a live project hosted on GitHub.
